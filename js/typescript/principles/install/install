npm i -g typescript

tsc --version

create my file .typescript = TS 
run in my terminal tsc script.js ( this file script.ts is the file that i want to compiler my code TS)
when i run my command "tsc script.ts" is going to compiler and create a  new file script.js;

if you want to watch ever changes in my file . typescript and compiler in ever change that i do.
the command is very simple you need to run:
"tcs mynamefile.ts -w"
